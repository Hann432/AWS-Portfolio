##1.  AWS Shared Responsbility model


![alt text](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/c5b76da3e608d34edb07244cd9b875ee86906328/2020/12/28/General-Shared-Responsibility-Model-on-AWS.jpg) 


##### AWS Shared Responsibility Model:


AWS Shared Responsibility Model divides security tasks between AWS and customers. AWS secures the cloud infrastructure, while customers handle data security, access management, and application configurations.

AWS Responsibilities_:

- Security of cloud infrastructure.
- Physical facilities, networking, and host OS._

#####Customer Responsibilities:

- Secure data and applications.
- Manage access.
- Configure applications.
- Implement IAM controls.


 

##2. AWS Identity and Access Management(Role)

####Key Objectives:

- IAM Roles in AWS grant secure access to resources.

- They offer temporary accesssupport cross-account access, and enable service roles. IAM Roles enhance security by adhering to the principle of least privilege, ensuring entities have only the necessary permissions.

##3. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Policy

#####Key Tasks:

- Creating a security group to permit web server access to your RDS DB instance.
- Establishing a DB subnet group to specify which subnets RDS can use for the database.
- Creating and configuring a Multi-AZ Amazon RDS for MySQL database instance to connect to the Aurora endpoint.

##4. Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
This hands-on experience has enriched my expertise in database management. ğŸš€ğŸ”‘ğŸ“Š

An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) in AWS is like a snapshot or a template of a virtual machine that contains the operating system, application server, and any additional software required to launch a virtual environment. Think of it as a pre-configured package that includes everything needed to run an instance on AWS.
 
AMIs serve as the starting point for creating new instances in the cloud. They can be customized with specific settings, software installations, security configurations, and more, reflecting a specific state or setup you want for your virtual machines. Once an AMI is created, it can be stored and used to launch multiple instances, ensuring consistency across these instances and saving time by avoiding the need to set up each instance manually.
 
Users can choose from a wide range of publicly available AMIs provided by AWS or create their own customized AMIs tailored to their specific needs. These images are crucial in efficiently deploying and scaling applications within the AWS cloud infrastructure.

#####Amazon EC2 Instance Types:


- T2: Good for small applications. websites and development/testing
- M5: Best for general-purpose - applications like web servers or app development.
- C5: Ideal for CPU-intensive tasks such as data processing and analytics.
- R5: Suitable for memory-intensive applications like in-memory databases.
- G4: Designed for graphics-intensive applications like gaming or video rendering.
- I3: Great for high-speed storage applications and NoSQL databases.



##6. Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

- What is it? A virtual network to launch AWS resources, giving you control over your network environment.
- Use Case: Provides isolated and customizable network configurations for secure and scalable cloud deployment.


##7. Difference Between Public and Private Subnet

![alt text](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*IjwTyOsITcjNNy0qRgwMAQ.jpeg)

- Public Subnet: It's accessible from the internet and can host resources like web servers.
-  Private Subnet: Not directly accessible from the internet. Typically used for database servers or internal resources, providing an added layer of security.
